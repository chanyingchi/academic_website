    text: <span>Great Knots (<i>alidris tenuirostris</i>) are  migratory shorebirds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway that fly each year between breeding grounds in the eastern Russian Arctic and nonbreeding grounds in Australia. They are also endangered. One major threat is the habitat destruction and degradation in coastal habitats in Asia, including the Yellow Sea, where they stop during their migration. In 2015-2017, a team of scientists from the Netherlands (University of Groningen and NIOZ), USA (US Geological Survey) and Australia, brought together by the Global Flyway Network, tracked Great Knots year-round with satellite transmitters. This is the first time that the entire migration journey has been tracked. Here we show the tracks of some individuals in 2016 and the habitats they were at.<span>
